Todo:

- GPU memory occupation problem
- loss function
- learning the square moving
- learning the UCF

- try fix all 15 frames and use the network to learn, it should be very easy that each frame is 40*40 and hidden state is 800.

- 找出之前看到的一个讲怎么做DL的slide


July 18:

- try remove the dense connection before LSTM
	- the color mving sqs can be learned with just one conv layer AE. 
	- probably need to add conv layers as compensation
- generate more results:
--- after each epoch
--- for more test cases
- add folder: stored_results, current_results
- maybe it's because too many conv layers? try to enalrge the sqs. 
- [high] Add greedily train layer by layer
- [high] Add a center/standarization operation in our generated data

July 19 early morning:
- review LSTM cell mechanism √
- see how the LSTM cell in Keras work √
- see if the "inversed sequence" is the right way to implement what diego proposed to wire the LSTM cell (h1 -> h1', h2-> h2' and h3-> h3') √
- implement the function to generate UCF data; 
	- the function should specify the FPS and lenth of sequence, return a train_data and val_data
- then try which model work on UCF data
- try the inter-reversed wiring with UCF, and then the bi-directino with
